# Vet-Clinic-Database

In this project I have created a relational database to create the initial data structure for a vet clinic. I have created a table to store animals' information, insert some data into it, and query it.

# Prerequisite

- Create a table named `animals` with the following columns:
 - `id`: integer
 - `name`: string
 - `date_of_birth`: date
 - `escape_attempts`: integer
 - `neutered`: boolean
 - `weight_kg`: decimal


## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
